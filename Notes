Process 

1. Find something to scrape, http://www.theskint.com/2014/06/2014-free-outdoor-movies-guide.html
2. What data do we want to grab and what want to do with it 
  - date, movie name, location, link to event webpage
  - can put in collection at first but probably want to create movie objects
  - eventually would be cool to have app email you each week with what free movies there are that week 
3. Connecte computers so we could pair 
4. Grabbed doc with nokogiri .css method & began playing with it in pry to see how we could extrac the data we wanted 
5. As figured out how to extract data we would put that in ruby file,https://www.evernote.com/shard/s159/sh/538eeafe-3180-41c8-acee-207b75678b61/bb54f98790d347171697dd25921f3198
  - ruby file was super unorganized but that was ok becuase we're just playing right now 
  - how we would pair - would trade off trying things in pry and suggest things to each other 
  - at first I was afraid to suggest things becuase it might be wrong, but after a bit it became easier to just throw out ideas and be like oh that doesn't work 
  - we started to feed off each other's ideas.  Em woudl come up with a super slick way to access the data that I probably never would have come up with but didn't see what to do next becuase she had been focusing on the last task and since I hadn't been bogged down I saw the next move faster
